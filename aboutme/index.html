    <p><b>Here is a little bit about me: I was born in Mexico City. 
        <p>My parents brought me to California, USA, thirty years ago. </p>
        <p>I've been living here ever since. My parents raised six children.</p>
        My husband and I have a son aged six years old.</p>
        <p>I am bilingual in Spanish and English.</p>
         <p>Currently, I work in a high school helping students that struggle with mental health issues on a daily basis.</p>
         <p>Although I have a very busy schedule every day, I am very rewarded by it.</p> 
        <p>I am currently a bachelor's degree in technology because I am interested in learning more about hardware computers, web design, and some programming. 
        <p>My favorite hobby is riding my bike for more than 15 miles almost every day. The outdoors is my favorite place to be.
