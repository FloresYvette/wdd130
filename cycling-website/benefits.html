                Cycles are also considered a great stress buster as they improve mental outlook. 
                Social anxiety sufferers can take advantage of biking as an outlet to interact in a healthy way.
                Boosting the immune system is one of the best things about biking and exercising in general. 
                Bike riding improves blood flow. 
                It helps increase heart rate and increases blood oxygenation. All of these actions improve one's immune system.

            Bike commuting can help you start your day without feeling stressed.
            Cycling offers therapeutic benefits because it promotes mindfulness. 
            When we focus on the physical and engage mind and body purely on riding, we are brought away from negative thoughts, which take on a greater significance when we obsess over them.
            You'll be surprised how cycling can improve your sleep routine. 
            You will be able to sleep peacefully at night by improving your mental health, controlling your stress levels, and minimizing your anxiety. 
            Physical activity and being outdoors are two of the main reasons people prefer biking. 
            Many people find that solo bike rides provide an opportunity for them to process their thoughts. 
            Among other things, they are able to think about life's responsibilities.
