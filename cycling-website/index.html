            <h2>SEE THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY FROM A BYCYCLE </h2>
        <p>
            The benefits of cycling go beyond being a great workout, but cycling can also be a great hobby for adventure seekers, 
            letting you discover landscapes and views you would have missed when driving your car. 
            A number of ways can be used to exercise, but recent research has shown that employees who bike to work are more productive. 
            When we bike around our communities, we gain a greater appreciation for the beauty of the landscape.
            It is not just good for your mental and cardiovascular health that biking is a great activity.

           <h2> RIDE YOUR BIKE </h2>
        <p>
            A person's cycling skills can only be improved by making regular trips on a bike.
            Cycling in different environments can teach a person how to handle different terrains. 
            A person's awareness also safeguards them and ensures they are aware of their surroundings. 
            Among other things, it helps the individual learn how to ascend, descend, turn corners, and move quickly. 
            Besides learning how to handle and utilize one's body weight, one must learn about the bike. 
            A person's cycling skills can only be improved by making regular trips on a bike.
            If you are traveling short distances through heavy traffic, you will often be able to travel faster by bike than in an automobile.

    <h2>CYCLING IS GOOD FOR YOU</h2>
    <p class="dot-lines">
    You can park your bicycle at the front of the lot and avoid paying tolls when you reach your destination. 
    Taking the bike for a ride during the day can serve as your exercise for the day, so it is possible to make up for any time lost, as you won't have to schedule additional time for exercise. 
    It will be difficult to notice you are exercising when you are cycling with your family members. 
    Cycling increases your child's fitness awareness as well as prevents a child from becoming overweight. 
    Children are kept active by riding bikes. 
    For children to develop strong, healthy bones and muscles, most health experts recommend an hour of physical activity daily.
