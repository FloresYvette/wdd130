        <p>
            Biking provides many opportunities to enjoy and explore the outdoors in California. 
            Make small rides and pick one goal, such as climbing a mountain or visiting your favorite market that you want to visit, and then work your way up to that.

       <p> By riding bikes, people can pick up food, go for coffee, and shop at local stores, spending money within the neighborhood. 
        The League of American Bicyclists reports that people who ride bikes are more likely to return to their local stores.
        There are many benefits to traveling by bike in comparison to driving a car. 
        First, bicycles are a lot less expensive to maintain than cars. </p>
